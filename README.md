Hello!

In this project I revisited Python and programming for the first time in a year. Since I felt I had become rather rusty I started with a project I already done once before.

This was a fun little project that once again got me familirazied with Python. I also developed it a bit more, like adding the abilit to read and write budget txt files.

Now IÂ´m looking forward to further sharpen my skills in python by starting with building the program as a GUI application! :)
