Hello!

In this project, I revisited Python and programming for the first time in a year. Since I felt I had become rather rusty I started with a project I had already done once before.

This was a fun little project that once again got me familiarized with Python. I also developed it a bit more, like adding the ability to read and write budget in txt format.

Now IÂ´m looking forward to further sharpening my skills in Python by starting with building the program as a GUI application in Tkinter! :)
